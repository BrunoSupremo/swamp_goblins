Additions:
(for ACE mod) Bee skep recipe to shaman (thanks P3rdit1ous)
(for Fisher mod) fishers can get cattail resources (random junk) instead of fish (higher chances at low levels)

Changes:
Goblin babies now respects the town alert and go to banner/hearths with everyone else.
Goblin babies will try to flee from near enemies.

Fixes:
(for ACE mod) Shamans can harvest beehives
(for Box o Vox mod) Fixed custom hearths from modded kingdoms (e.g. our goblins) being replaced by vanilla firepit (which bugged the campaigns). (Only for new saves :( )
Downed goblin babies can now be rescued without errors. (thanks for the report Rons)
