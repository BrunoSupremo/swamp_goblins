Additions:
Clay windows (square 2x2 and wide 3x2)
Fancy House template (tier 3, clay materials). This is the first t3 template, and is probably the direction these new high tier templates will go.
Wall Hanging Ring, small decoration


Changes:
Magma Workbench more accessible, requiring any ores instead of coal to craft it
Any modded jobs should now be available for goblins (outfits may be wonky if not properly done for goblin shapes, but the mod authors can easily exclude/restrict a job if desired)
Reduced firefly golem speed, it was way too fast
Improved shaman recipe list, better mod compatibility and additions (e.g. ACE and herbalist items)
Nerfed Giant Doodle (egg raid at 10 pop) menace score, so fighters should not run away from combat
Improved Stone Door model, to better differentiate from vanilla, and avoid a small z-fight


Changes for ACE:


Fixes:
Reduced the unbalanced spam of some landmarks when using "plenty landmark" option from Extra Map Options mod


Fixes for ACE:
Removed ui pet controls from Dragon Spirit
Nina (leader from the campaign) got her healing powers back
