Additions:
Stone chest, with space for 48 items

Changes:
Slightly better hunting, goblins only detects possible targets in a 48 blocks range (instead of default 64) and darts will slow critters way more, for a longer time, and do more damage. This should help with faster hunting and less chasing.
Clay chest capacity bumped from 48 to 64 items

Fixes:
Giant Mushrooms spawned by geomancers now properly drops mushroom food when mined
