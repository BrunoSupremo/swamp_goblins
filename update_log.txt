Additions:
Wide wall banner decoration and recipe
Lamppost decoration and recipe

Changes:
Renamed Shaman recipes Tools category to Talismans, for clarity.
Goblins start with two plantable violet plants instead of two rocks.
New egg and baby icons (thanks Stmpnk)
Decreased Knight and Nina (from the human camp) "fighting" area, so they will only attack players that get really close to the camp (~30 blocks)
Removed weapon and armor traders showing at tier 1 as they are a big noob trap (those items do not fit the goblins classes)

Fixes:
The human camp could be killed by other enemies and move the campaign forward without the player interaction. They would also ally with everyone else once befriended by the player. They should now properly be ignored by other enemies until they are allied with players.
